            <p>Hello, I am a high school student 
            interested in pursuing a career in software engineering and my university major of choice 
            is computer science or computer engineering. I was teaching myself coding before this course 
            as I did tutorials/guides on websites such as w3schools.com, python official website, 
            codecademy, sololearn and watched various videos on youtube on python and ruby programming 
            languages. One of my favourite youtubers for learning python is freecodecamp.org as they have 
            detailed instructions. I started learning coding a short while ago so I’m still new but I find 
            it very interesting and would like to learn more. Some other interests of mine are sketching 
            (I originally came to high school wanting to learn about animation), swimming 
            (I’ve completed all the lifeguarding courses in mississauga community centers), 
            piano (I’m currently on the last level of royal conservatory piano and I was planning on 
            taking my exam before the pandemic arrived), violin (I used to play a lot in schools as I was 
            part of my middle school’s strings chambre and we even won a certificate but I’m not too good), 
            chess (I used to compete in peel student chess tournaments, basketball (I enjoy team sports 
            and the communication, responsibility, hard work and teamwork skills I’ve learned playing the 
            sport has been invaluable) and breakdancing (I find it very cool and though I don’t take lessons, 
            I learn from home similar to coding). I also love animals and I enjoy learning about nature.</p>

        <h2>Role Models</h2>

            <figcaption>By: Keith Allison from Hanover, MD, USA</figcaption>
            <p>This is one of my biggest 
            role models and his name is Russell Westbrook. He's an NBA point guard currently playing for
            the Washington Wizards but spent most of his career playing for my favourite team (OKC Thunder).
            I really admire him since he's known for his hard work and intensity and I remember the first
            time I watched the NBA, he could not miss a shot and was flying past everyone dishing out for
            assists, shooting mid range pullups and zooming past defenders for ferocious dunks. Many people
            don't like him since he isn't a great 3 point shooter by NBA standards and he doesn't have any
            championships right now but everybody knows he's one of the best players ever and can do 
            everything on the court. He's known as Mr. Triple Double which means that he had double digit 
            assists, rebounds and points in a single game which is super rare but he set a new record averaging 
            a triple double for 3 seasons straight which has never been done before. He even won NBA League MVP 
            in 2017 averaging a 30 point triple double and carrying an injured Thunder roster to the playoffs 
            and is a 9 time NBA all star and has made 6 all nba selections. As a kid, Westbrook was never 
            the best player and was often eclipsed by his best friend named Khelcey Barrs. Barrs died of heart
            failure and collapsed all of a sudden while they were playing basketball and ever since then, 
            Westbrook plays for his friend by taking his jersey number 0. Off the court, Westbrook's motto
            is "Why Not" which means if you want to do something, go for it. Why can't you be the best? Why
            shouldn't you do what you believe in? And so on. He also shows his own style by playing a flashy,
            athletic, but also unselfish style of basketball on the court while pulling off clothes (and other
            fashion items) others would be afraid to wear. I admire his hard work, determination, skill, flare
            and confidence in himself not backing down to anyone.</p>
